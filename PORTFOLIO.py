Recently graduated with a degree in "B.Sc. in Computer Science" from "Mahatma Gandhi Kashi Vidyapith University" Varanasi,Utter Pradesh , I have developed a keen interest in using data to solve real-world problems.

During my studies, I completed realtime projects on 'Sentimental Analysis','face detection'/'face recognition attendace system','Movies recommandation system'..etc and earned certifications in "Data Science" by "Ducat India Institute" Noida.

I am skilled in Python, SQL,data manupulation and data visualization tools like Power BI, Matplotlib. My passion lies in exploring data patterns and leveraging machine learning algorithms to generate actionable insights. I am eager to contribute to challenging projects that push the boundaries of innovation in data science.
